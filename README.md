the file takes (train ,test ,updated_test , network)

train is the path to the training set file
test is the path to the missing values file 
updated_test is the name of the new file that will be generated
network is a write of the Bayesian netwrok

the test set for "stormofswords" contained unseen values. Therfore it doesn't work with our implementation

It seems that some of the values in the test set of "stormofswords" are miss labeld
